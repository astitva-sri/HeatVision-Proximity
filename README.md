# **HeatVision Proximity**

Welcome to HeatVision Proximity! This Android app is part of a major project for BTech's 4th year. It serves as a monitoring app that sends notifications to users when a human is detected by its counterpart device. The device utilizes heat signature detection to differentiate between humans and other objects, enabling it to detect humans and push notifications to the app accurately.

## Key Features

- Human Detection: The app receives notifications when the device detects a human.
- Timestamp Display: Users can view the timestamp at which the detection occurred.
- Image Capture: The app displays an image captured at the time of detection.
- Authentication: Proper authentication process ensures that only authorized users can access device data.
- Integration with MongoDB: Device data is stored in a MongoDB database.
- Firebase Integration: The app fetches timestamp data and images from Firebase database.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this Git repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/astitva-sri/HeatVision-Proximity.git
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**: Open the project in Android Studio.

3. **Connect Firebase**: Connect the app to Firebase by creating a new project in the Firebase console and following the setup instructions. Make sure to enable Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database.

4. **Integrate with MongoDB**: Ensure that the device data is properly stored in the MongoDB database.

5. **Run the App**: Run the app on an emulator or a physical Android device to test its functionality.

## Usage

- Upon launching the app, users will be prompted to log in with their credentials.
- Once authenticated, users will receive notifications when the device detects a human.
- Users can view the timestamp and image captured during detection.
- Proper authentication ensures that only authorized users can access the device data.
